# bee-prolific
Application to track non-commercial efforts to encourage the proliferation of honey bee populations. 

The European Honey Bee is responsible for pollinating up to one-third of the food we eat. Due to the wide spread use of mono-culture, our food chain is highly dependent upon commerical beekeeping, essentially trucking beehive around the country to match the pollination cycles of flowering plants and trees. 

However, commercial beekeeping necessiates the use of chemicals and pesticides to maintain their bee populations, making them increasingly susceptible to chemical-resistant and newly-introducted pests. 

On the other hand, feral honeybees are forced to develop strategies to mitigate threats to their colony. Some examples are
- bees ecapsulating hive bettles in wax, 
- sick bees or those attached by a mite leaving the hive, and 
- bees clustering around wasps to raise the temperature sufficiently to kill the wasp. 

Hence, encouraging the prolification of feral honeybees not only increases the population, 
- necessary if just to counter colony collapse disorder, but 
- also to improve genetic diversity. 

For instance, most bees in the southern US are said to be Africanized to some exent. Though this might increase agressive behavior, it also increases honey production: a colony's only defense against a temporary lack of pollen for food. 

The purpose of this application is to track the placement and results of backyard apiaries, nuclues (NUC) colony boxes which can be split into additional NUCs as colonies prosper, and swarm traps to encourage feral bees to start a colony that can be propogated. 

The user community will be amatuer , "back yard" beekeepers, beekeeping clubs, and professional apiarists, particularly those who trap swarms or collect "feral" hives. 

I have looked into grafetee, openstreetmap and Google maps as possible alternative solutions. Palm Beach Beekeepers Association does have a swarm trap application using grafetee. Openstreetmap does have a feature for "beekeeper", but it is more atuned to commercial apiaries. The Code for Miami Transit application uses Google maps, which means a community exists to help with the effort.
