Application to track non-commercial efforts to encourage the proliferation of honey bee populations. 

The European Honey Bee is responsible for pollinating up to one-third of the food we eat. Due to the wide spread use of mono-culture, our food chain is highly dependent upon commerical beekeeping, essentially trucking beehive around the country to match the pollination cycles of flowering plants and trees. 

However, commercial beekeeping necessiates the use of chemicals and pesticiles to maintain the bee populations. This means that the commercial hives are increasingly susceptible to chemical-resistant and newly-introducted pests. 

On the other hand, wild bees are forced to develop strategies to mitigate threats ot their colony. Some examples are bees ecapsulating hive bettles in wax, leaving the hive if sick or attached by a mite, and clustering around wasps to raise the temperature sufficiently to kill the wasp. 

Hence, encouraging the prolification of bees not only increases the population, necessary if just to counter colony collapse disorder, but improves genetic diversity. For instance, most bees in the southern US are said to be Africanized to some exent. Though this might increase agressive behavior, it also increases honey production, the bees only defense against a temporary lack of pollen for food. 

The purpose of this application is to track the placement and results of backyard apiaries, nuclues (NUC) colony boxes which can be split into additional NUCs as colonies prosper, and swarm traps. 

The user community will be amatuer beekeepers, beekeeping clubs, and professional apiarists, particularly those who trap swarms or remove "feral" hives. 

I have looked into grafetee, openstreetmap and Google maps as possible alternative solutions. Palm Beach Beekeepers Association does have a swarm trap application using grafetee. Openstreetmap does have a feature for "beekeeper", but it is more atuned to commercial apiaries. The Code for Miami Transit application uses Google maps, which means a community exists to help with the effort.
